Speed of Light Travel Simulation

This project offers a simulation of space travel from Earth to different destinations at the speed of light. Through user input, you can experience the time it would take to arrive at your chosen destination if you were traveling at the speed of light.

How It Works

Run the travel_from_earth.py script, which imports the LightTravel class and contains all necessary logic.

Upon execution, you'll be presented with a list of destinations, along with their respective distances from Earth.

Choose your desired destination and observe the simulated travel time, as the program counts down the seconds it would take to travel to your selected location at the speed of light.
Disclaimer: 
This project is purely educational and intended for fun. It does not provide accurate representations of space travel, distances, or physics. Enjoy the experience but remember it's 
just a simulation!



I've improved the code readability by making some changes and introduced the option to select both a current location and a preferred destination. The modifications have been consolidated into two files. Additionally, I've included a dictionary comprising nested dictionaries, detailing distances between solar system items and other celestial objects.
