Speed of Light Travel Simulation
This project offers a simulation of space travel between various celestial destinations, enabling users to experience the relative travel times at speeds approaching or equal to the speed of light. Through user input, participants can select from a range of spacecraft, each with its own speed, to journey from their current location to a chosen destination within the solar system and beyond.

How It Works
Run the main.py script, which has been enhanced to include a dynamic selection system. This system allows users to choose their starting point, destination, and spacecraft using numeric input, thereby improving usability and interaction.

Upon execution:

You will first select your current location from a provided list of celestial bodies.
Next, choose your desired destination to see the distance and simulated travel time at your spacecraft's speed.
Finally, select your spacecraft based on the available options, each listed with its speed relative to the speed of light.
Features
Dynamic Selection System: Users can now make selections using numbers, simplifying the process and minimizing input errors.
Expanded Destination Options: Includes a comprehensive list of celestial bodies and artificial destinations, with distances calculated from the user's chosen starting location.
Multiple Spacecraft Selection: Offers a variety of spacecraft, each with specified speeds, allowing for diverse travel time simulations.
Disclaimer
This project is purely educational and intended for fun. It does not provide accurate representations of space travel, distances, or physics. Enjoy the experience, but remember, it's just a simulation!
